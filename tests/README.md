# **Test Cases for Lib Utils**

- ### This folder contains the source codes of instant test scenarios created for the designed utils functions.

- ### You can use this area for any purpose you want, it's not relevant to the project.

## Compiling Sources

- Simply use `make all` to compile all of your source files. `all` directive \
creates `.o` executable for each source file (same name as source file has) \
and puts these `.o` files in the `./out` directory.
