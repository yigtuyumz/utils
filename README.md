# **Utilites for C**

I created a dynamic C library by detecting the functions which i am using mostly.

## **_Folder Structure_**
- ### *./include/*
	Contains header files.
- ### *./lib/*
	Includes dynamic library(ies). *(final step of the project)*
- ### *./obj/*
	For every source file, compiler creates an object file and puts in here.
	All of the object files are located in here.
- ### *./src/*
	The source files.
	For each function, I created a source file with the same name as the function.
